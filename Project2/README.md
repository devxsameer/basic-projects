I created a simple yet visually appealing **Profile Card** using only **HTML** and **CSS**, based on a reference image.

---

## 🛠️ What I Used

- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling
  - Box model
  - Shadows (`box-shadow`)
  - Fonts & text alignment
  - Spacing with `margin` & `padding`
  - Flexbox for alignment
  - Responsive units (`%`, `rem`, `em`)
